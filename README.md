# Tweet labeling - 
ML course hackathon project
---------------------------

As part of a hackathon in an Introduction to machine learning course, we were given a dataset of tweets produces by 10 different celebrities (Cristiano Ronaldo, Lady GaGa, Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen Degeneres, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Conan O'brien, Lebron Jamesn, Joe Biden). 

Our goal was to build a learner that given a new tweet could predict which celebrity produced it. 

The full implementation and results appear in the project.pdf file
